The goal of huebreaker is to find the cluster based tree and metadata of the data. The package is based on the paper:

Ragonnet-Cronin, M., Hodcroft, E., Hué, S. et al. Automated analysis of phylogenetic clusters. BMC Bioinformatics 14, 317 (2013). <https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-317>

This package is the part of Dhihram Tenrisau, MSc Health Data Science summer project, 'Phylodynamic of Norovirus in UK 2003-2023'. The project is supervised by Stéphane Hué
